        overview: 'This project focuses on optimising the profitability of Co Wheels, a UK-based car-sharing service, through the development and implementation of a dynamic pricing strategy. The project leverages historical booking data from January 2019 to April 2024 and employs machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), XGBoost Regressors, and Decision Tree Regressors, to predict hourly and daily rates for various vehicle types. Key demand factors such as peak hours, seasonality, and location popularity are integrated into the models to enhance pricing accuracy. A web-based simulation tool is developed to visualise the impact of adjusted pricing strategies on profitability. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in revenue generation, with dynamic pricing outperforming static pricing by 19.32% in test scenarios. The study highlights the potential of machine learning in optimising pricing strategies while promoting sustainable transportation and reducing carbon emissions.',
        challenges: 'I solved several challenges faced by Co Wheels in a competitive and seasonally variable car-sharing market. One of the primary challenges is the uniform pricing model currently in use, which fails to account for regional and temporal demand variations. This leads to suboptimal revenue generation, especially during peak hours and high-demand seasons. Additionally, the price sensitivity of B2C journeys, which are often discretionary, poses a challenge in balancing profitability with customer satisfaction. The study also highlights the difficulty of integrating real-time data sources, such as economic indicators, competitor pricing, and weather conditions, into the pricing model. Furthermore, the potential for customer dissatisfaction due to frequent price changes and regulatory constraints in various regions adds complexity to the implementation of dynamic pricing strategies.',

        overview: "Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The simplest form involves two variables: a dependent variable (y) and an independent variable (x), with the goal of finding the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. The linear regression equation is represented as `y = mx + b`, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In multiple linear regression, the equation extends to include more independent variables. Linear regression is widely used for prediction tasks, assuming a linear relationship between variables. This introduction also provides a step-by-step Python implementation of linear regression, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization, using a dataset that predicts student scores based on study hours.",

Another challenge is providing sufficient context for the dataset used in the example, ensuring that readers understand how the method applies to real-world scenarios.
